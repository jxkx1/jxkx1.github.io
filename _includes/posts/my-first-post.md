Welcome to my inaugural blog post. I decided to create this post as an opportunity to share my recent experiences and future plans with you.

## A Strong Start to the Year
- ### Internship at State Street
At the beginning of 2024, I landed an internship at State Street as a Cyber Defense Intern. This experience has been invaluable, allowing me to connect with skilled professionals and learn about the inner workings of a large organization in the cybersecurity domain. Although it differed from my typical Capture the Flag activities, it was a great chance to broaden my understanding of the cybersecurity landscape.

## Capture the Flag Successes
- ### Competitive Achievements
I was honored to place first at the ZeroDays 2024 Capture the Flag competition, representing my college. This achievement was the result of extensive practice and preparation by our team. I also placed third at the BeSide Dublin 2024 Capture the Flag event, which I consider a significant personal accomplishment. Participating in these CTF competitions has been an exhilarating experience that has pushed me to develop my skills further.

## Expanding My Toolbox
- ### Learning New Technologies
I am particularly proud of the progress I have made in working with Docker containers and modular deployment. These tools have become integral to my workflow, and I have had the opportunity to develop a platform for my company using these technologies. The creative freedom and trust given to me during this project allowed me to dive deep into understanding the intricacies of front-facing services and Docker containers.

## Looking Ahead
- ### Future Plans
As I prepare to return to college, I am excited to embark on new projects. I look forward to sharing more about my upcoming endeavors. If any of you have interesting ideas or tips to share, please feel free to reach out to me. My contact information is available somewhere on this site.

Losing my previous portfolio was disappointing, but I see it as a chance to start fresh and create an even better blog experience.

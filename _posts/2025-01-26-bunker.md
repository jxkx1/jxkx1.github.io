## Description

**[REPORT]** Mail notification received from access point.  
**Subject:** YoRHa_CLASSIFIED_12u3440029491  
**Origin:** Bunker  
**Query:** What is the nature of this transmission?  
**Hypothesis:** A deeper analysis of the enclosed files may yield more information.  
**Proposal:** A scanner-type unit is advised to perform standard scanning procedures on the data for further analysis and conclusions.  
**Warning:** Data appears to be classified. Any actions related to hacking or unauthorized transactions could be associated with treason. The unit is advised to perform such acts in secrecy.

## Tools Used

- file
- WinDBG
- keepass-password-dumper
- CyberChef

## Approach

### Initial Analysis

Upon extracting the challenge zip file, I encountered two files: "Bunker_DB" and "Bunker_DMP." My first thought was that one was a database file and the other was a memory dump. I ran the `file` command to identify the specifics, revealing a Mini DuMP crash report and a KeePass 2.x KDBX database.

### Enumeration

Knowing the file types and versions, I conducted some online research and discovered that certain versions of KeePass 2 were vulnerable to [CVE-2023-32784](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-32784). This vulnerability allowed users to extract the KeePass database master password from a memory dump captured while there was any swap or process data present. This seemed like a promising attack vector.

### Exploitation

**Step 1:**  
I used WinDBG to inspect the Mini DuMP file and found active KeePass processes inside it.

**Step 2:**  
Since this was a CVE, I assumed there would be automated scripts available. I searched GitHub and found [`keepass-password-dumper`](https://github.com/vdohney/keepass-password-dumper). I ran the script and successfully retrieved the password, though the first character was missing. Based on the length of the password, I guessed the first letter was 'g'â€”and I was correct.

**Step 3:**  
After logging into the KeePass app, I found two accounts that appeared to be example accounts. While they provided no useful information, I discovered a user named "backdoor_pw" in the recycle bin. Its password was "REDACTEDREDACTEDREDACTED," which seemed unhelpful at first. However, it contained a suspicious note in hexadecimal format, which looked promising.

**Step 4:**  
I used CyberChef to decode the hexadecimal string, which resulted in what seemed to be Japanese text.

 I then turned to Google Translate, but the result was a proverb, leading me to believe this was a dead end.

**Step 5:**  
Returning to the KeePass vault, I checked the password history for the "backdoor_pw" account by navigating to `right click > edit entries > history`.

There, I found an original entry for the password: `TUCTF{Th1s_C4nn0T_ConT1nu3}`.

## Solution

- **Flag:** `TUCTF{Th1s_C4nn0T_ConT1nu3}`
